# About Me
Most professionals tend to specialize in either technical analysis or interpersonal communication, but my career has been defined by the ability to do both. With a background in food science, I worked in a fast-paced startup environment where I helped develop cutting-edge food technologies aimed at transforming how people eat and live. I designed and ran experiments, interpreted complex data, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to bring innovative products to the fresh produce industry. That experience taught me how to think critically under pressure, solve problems creatively, and communicate clearly across disciplines.

Today, as a full stack software engineer, I bring that same agility and focus to the world of technology. I write clean, efficient code with an emphasis on user experience, scalability, and maintainability. My scientific mindset keeps me detail-oriented, while my startup background makes me adaptable and impact-driven. My goal is to provide technical depth with people-first thinking to build solutions that matter. My name is Winnie. Nice to meet you!
